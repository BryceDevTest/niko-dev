# ⚔️ Broski: Manifesto of a Grey Hat Dreamer ⚔️

> *"In the neon alleyways of Montréal, behind firewalls and the faint glow of LCDs, lives a cat-loving, code-slinging anomaly they call **Broski***."

## 🧠 Who TF is Broski?

- 🐧 **OS**: Kubuntu — Potato edition. If it ain't minimal, it ain't real.
- 💻 **Rig**: Laughs at RAM limits. Breaks code like bread.
- 🧑‍💻 **Alignment**: Chaotic Good — Grey Hat forever. I don’t break laws, I bend ‘em creatively.
- 🧨 **Hobbies**: Cracking code, purring with cats, dodging normies.
- 🧭 **Base of Operations**: Fab Lab, St-Henri, Montréal. Underground, ungovernable.

## ⚙️ Toolkit of Madness

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `nmap` | Checking what *they* forgot to lock |
| `burpsuite` | Sip data, break walls |
| `bash` + `python` | My twin blades |
| `VPN + Tor` | Privacy over everything |
| `neovim` | GUI? Nah, I write in pure chaos. |
| `exploit-db` | My bedtime storybook |

## 😼 Philosophy

> 🧬 "Code is art. Firewalls are challenges. Ethics? Flexible."

- Not here to destroy. Here to **understand**.
- Not here to follow. Here to **find the cracks** in the matrix.
- I read logs like others read love letters.
- I don’t *ask permission* from the machine. I *interrogate* it.

## 🧙 Lore
